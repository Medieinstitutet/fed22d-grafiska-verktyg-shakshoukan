## Instructions

### Link to the design -> [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/OtAz1ov1w1RhxiQ3ur8T3V/Shakshouka?node-id=0%3A1&t=wJpqy4Wf7I2kXFuu-1)

### Main view
The main view with the background image is supposed to take up 100% of the viewport height. Remaining content is accessed when scrolling down. 

### Header
The header is fixed to the top when scrolling. If possible - ideally it disappears when scrolling down but reappears when the user starts scrolling up again. This to avoid that the elements overlap when the user has scrolled down, but still have the menu easily accessible. 

### Buttons and links
The hover states for buttons and links can be found on the components page in the Figma file. 

### Menu
When hamburger icon is clicked on in mobile and tablet view the menu is slided in from the right.

### Slider
In the slider navigation there are three dots to indicate active card in the cards order. The actice card has a larger dot than the inactive cards.

### Cookie box
The cookie Box is fixed to viewport bottom until clicked.
